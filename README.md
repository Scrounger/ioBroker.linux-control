## Linux Control Adapter for ioBroker
[![paypal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=VWAXSTS634G88&source=url)

Controlling Linux devices and get information about your system

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Configuration

### General
![General](docs/en/img/general.png)

|setting|description|
|-------|-----------|
|enabled|enabled or disable updating of the host|
|datapoint id|id under which all datapoints are to be stored|
|IP|IP address of your linux device|
|Port|SSH Port of your linux device|
|polling interval|polling interval in minutes.<br>To deatcivate the polling you can use '0' or leave it blank|
|user|ssh user for login|
|password / passpharse|ssh password for login or passpharse if you use a rsa key|
|use Sudo| using sudo |
|rsa key|path and filename of your rsa key. Access rights must be available!|
|timeout|connection timeout|

### Datapoints
![Datapoints](docs/en/img/datapoints.gif)

The adapter creates predefined datapoints with information and the possibility to control the Linux device. These can be selected here.
In addition, for each individual host, individual data points or entire channels can be placed on the blacklist by drag & drop so that they are not created for the host.

Note if you would like to add the whole channel to the blacklist, you must drag & drop the channel node to the blacklist. Only then the whole channel will be ignored - see sreenshot below:

![Datapoints](docs/en/img/all_to_blacklist.gif)

**Due to the many different Linux distributions this feature is only tested with Debian 10, Ubuntu 18 / 20 LTS!**

### Services
![Services](docs/en/img/services.png)

If the retrieval of services under datapoints is activated, you can define here per host for which services only information should be retrieved.

**Due to the many different Linux distributions this feature is only tested with Debian 10, Ubuntu 18 / 20 LTS!**

### Folders
![Folders](docs/en/img/folders.png)

Here you can retrieve information about the size of folders, count of the files included in these folders and the timestamp of the last change in this folder.

**Due to the many different Linux distributions this feature is only tested with Debian 10, Ubuntu 18 / 20 LTS!**

|setting|description|
|-------|-----------|
|enabled|enabled or disable updating of the folder|
|Host|Host which should be used|
|datapoint id|id under which all datapoints are to be stored|

|Unit|Unit for size|

|last change|create datapoint for timestamp of the last change in this folder|

### My Commands
![Custom Commands](docs/en/img/myCommands.png)

Here, very individual commands can be defined and then written to your own defined data points.
It is important that the retrieved data is transmitted in the correct type! The type must then be configured accordingly.

|setting|description|

|enabled|enabled or disable updating of the command|
|Host|Host which should be used|
|datapoint id|id under which datapoints are to be stored|
|polling interval|diffrent polling interval in seconds for the command only. For deactivating use `0` or leave the field blank, then the polling interval from the host is used|

|command|command that should be used <br><br>If you use a user that needs `sudo` then you have to add `sudo -S` to your own command!|
|type|type of the datapoint|
|unit|unit of the datapoint|
